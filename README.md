# My Node.js Project
This is a project I created to learn and practice Node.js. The project has 5 tasks:


# Task 1: Print "HELLO WORLD" to the console

# Task 2: Create a server that responds with "Hello Node!!!!"


# Task 3: Create a file named "welcome.txt" and console.log data from hello.txt


# Task 4: Generate random passwords and console.log() them


# Task 5: Send an email using Nodemailer
